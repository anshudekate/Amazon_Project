  # Amazon Sales
## Introduction
The Amazon Sales Report dataset aggregates granular, time-stamped transactional data from Amazon. It tracks order details such as status, fulfillment methods, sales channel, category, size, and shipment state. This enables a comprehensive assessment of sales efficiency, product performance, and customer behavior tailored, for data-driven decision-making.
## Abstract
This work analyzes a detailed simulation of Amazon sales data to extract actionable business insights.
‚Ä¢	Objective: Evaluate sales performance across categories, channels, and fulfillment types, while examining order and shipping statuses.
‚Ä¢	Data & Methodology: The dataset comprises nine key features‚ÄîOrder‚ÄØID, Date, Status, Fulfillment, Channel, Category, Ship Service Level, Size, and Carrier Status.
‚Ä¢	Tools Used: Excel for data cleaning and pivoting, SQL for relational queries and aggregations, and Power‚ÄØBI for interactive visualization (dashboards and reports).
‚Ä¢	Key Findings: Top-performing categories are ‚ÄúSet‚Äù and ‚ÄúKurta‚Äù; the majority of orders are shipped, with minimal cancellations or returns; fulfillment and channel-level throughput is measurable; size-wise sales visibility supports inventory planning.
‚Ä¢	Implications: Insights support optimized inventory, targeted marketing, and improved logistics strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Workflow
## Phase	Tool	Purpose
1. Data Ingestion & Cleansing	Excel (Power Pivot + Power Query)	Imported raw CSVs, handled missing values, standardized date formats and categories 
2. Data Transformation	SQL	Used relational queries to aggregate by status, channel, category, size, and time-series trends; streamlined for Power‚ÄØBI import
3. Analytics & Reporting	Power‚ÄØBI	Created interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs (sales amount, quantity), filter by size, analyze performance across segments, and track order/shipment lifecycle 
________________________________________
This setup offers a scalable, repeatable framework: raw data ‚Üí Excel preprocessing ‚Üí SQL staging ‚Üí Power‚ÄØBI visualization. It supports rich drilldown, performance tracking, and strategic insights________________________________________
## 1. Data Collection & Import
‚Ä¢	Excel / Power Query: Load raw CSV or spreadsheets. Use Power Query (Get & Transform) to import data into Excel
‚Ä¢	SQL: Import data into a relational database (e.g., SQL Server). This supports large dataset handling and complex transformations. Many BI workflows use SQL to pre-clean and aggregate data for efficient reporting 
________________________________________
## 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
‚Ä¢	Excel / Power Query: Clean missing values, normalize formats, duplicate using automated steps.
‚Ä¢	SQL: Refine data further‚Äîwrite queries to join related tables (e.g. orders, categories), filter by date or status, and aggregate metrics at category, size, or status. level
________________________________________
## 3. Data Modeling
‚Ä¢	Power Pivot (Excel): Create internal relationships and measures (e.g., total revenue, counts) in a tabular model 
‚Ä¢	SQL: Optionally build summary tables or views (fact & dimension tables) to feed models downstream.
________________________________________
## 4. Preparing Data for Reporting
‚Ä¢	SQL Views: Build optimized views with grouped metrics‚Äîe.g., revenue by category/status.
‚Ä¢	Power Query / Power BI: Connect to Excel tables and SQL views. Ensure query folding to push transformations to the database 
________________________________________
## 5. Visualization & Dashboarding in Power‚ÄØBI
‚Ä¢	Import / Live Connection: Bring in data from SQL or Excel.
‚Ä¢	Build model: Define relationships, hierarchies (date, category, size).
‚Ä¢	Create visuals: Charts, slicers, KPIs. Pin report visuals to a dashboard.
‚Ä¢	Add interactivity: Filters by size, time, and status.
________________________________________
## 6. Testing & Validation
‚Ä¢	SQL vs. DAX verification: Verify accuracy by comparing aggregation results from SQL and DAX in Power BI .
‚Ä¢	Refresh checks: Test data refresh flows‚ÄîExcel‚ÜíSQL‚ÜíPower BI.
________________________________________
## 7. Deployment & Sharing
‚Ä¢	Publish report and dashboard to Power‚ÄØBI Service.
‚Ä¢	Configure scheduled refreshes for up-to-date analysis.
‚Ä¢	Optionally, allow ‚ÄúAnalyze in Excel‚Äù, enabling users to connect Excel pivot tables to the live Power BI model.
________________________________________
## 8. Maintenance & Iteration
‚Ä¢	Monitor data quality and refresh logs.
‚Ä¢	Enhance model: Add features like time intelligence, forecasting, or cohort analysis.
‚Ä¢	Update visuals per stakeholder needs.
________________________________________
This workflow offers a reliable, scalable pipeline:
Raw data ‚Üí Excel (prep) ‚Üí SQL (staging & aggregation) ‚Üí Power BI (modeling & visualization) ‚Üí Dashboard publishing & refresh.________________________________________
## ‚úÖ Conclusion
‚Ä¢	Summary of Findings: The analysis revealed that ‚ÄúSet‚Äù and ‚ÄúKurta‚Äù categories lead in both revenue and sales volume. Most orders are fulfilled and shipped successfully, with minimal returns or cancellations. Size-wise segmentation uncovered demand concentrations useful for inventory and fulfillment planning.
‚Ä¢	Business Implications: These insights empower stakeholders to:
o	Fine-tune inventory by focusing on high-demand categories and sizes.
o	Optimize fulfillment processes by monitoring shipped vs. delivered status.
o	Tailor marketing strategies to top-performing segments and channels.
## ‚Ä¢	Recommendations:
1.	Inventory Optimization: Prioritize stock for ‚ÄúSet‚Äù and ‚ÄúKurta,‚Äù and use size-level visibility to maintain ideal inventory levels.
2.	Fulfillment Efficiency: Investigate delayed or canceled shipments to minimize revenue leakage.
3.	Channel & Size-specific Marketing: Use insights from sales channel and size trends to run targeted campaigns.
## ‚Ä¢	Next Steps:
o	Enhance the dashboard with forecasting features to predict future demand.
o	Conduct cohort or customer segmentation analysis to understand buying behavior and improve retention.
o	Integrate profit margin data and customer feedback to balance sales performance with profit effectiveness.
